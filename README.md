#[First Task : Function Optimization](https://github.com/Nemat-Allah-Aloush/Evolutionary_Computing/blob/main/ec_lab1_Aloush.ipynb)
The goal is to play around basic implementation of Genetic Algorithm and tune it in a way that it will able to find approximate optimal solution of given function.
The target function is modification of [Rastrgin function](https://www.sfu.ca/~ssurjano/rastr.html). It is reversed, displaced and scaled in such a way that result values are in range [0.0, 10.0].  Possible range of input variables are [-5, 5] for all variables.
Deap framework was used [here](https://deap.readthedocs.io/en/master/).
The algorithm must find solutions with fitness values around 9.9.
